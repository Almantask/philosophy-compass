# Reason, Evidence, and Truth

This note explores the interconnected concepts of reason, evidence, and truth in philosophy. These ideas are fundamental to understanding how we justify beliefs and arrive at knowledge.

## Reason
Reason is the capacity for consciously making sense of things, applying logic, and adapting or justifying practices, institutions, and beliefs based on new or existing information.

## Evidence
Evidence refers to the information or data that supports or counters a claim, theory, or belief. It plays a crucial role in rational decision-making and scientific inquiry.

## Truth
Truth is the property of being in accord with fact or reality. Philosophical discussions about truth often involve questions about its nature, criteria, and relation to belief and knowledge.
