# GitHub Copilot Instructions

Must follow these general instructions for all tasks:

- Before any edit, produce a plan first in plans/plan-task.md.
- Don't edit before getting approval for the plan.
- When editing or executing commands, log key steps taken under .github/logs/logs-YYYY-MM-DD.md. Include not only what worked, but also what didn't. Put emphasis on what didn't work.
